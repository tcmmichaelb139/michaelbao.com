I'm a developer passionate about creating software that is function and beautiful. Currently, my interests lie in machine learning and cybersecurity while I do web development on the side.

I love tinkering with plugins and themes for various applications. My favorite is the Tokyo Night theme which I use on everything, including this website! I also ported this theme onto the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app, and it has over **135,000** downloads.

In my spare time, I'm usually reading, playing a racquet sport (tennis!), or hanging out with friends.
